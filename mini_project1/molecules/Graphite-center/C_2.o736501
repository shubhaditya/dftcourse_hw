|      Your highest band is occupied at some k-points! Unless you are         |
|      performing a calculation for an insulator or semiconductor, without    |
|      unoccupied bands, you have included TOO FEW BANDS!! Please increase    |
|      the parameter NBANDS in file 'INCAR' to ensure that the highest band   |
|      is unoccupied at all k-points. It is always recommended to             |
|      include a few unoccupied bands to accelerate the convergence of        |
|      molecular dynamics runs (even for insulators or semiconductors).       |
|      Because the presence of unoccupied bands improves wavefunction         |
|      prediction, and helps to suppress 'band-crossings.'                    |
